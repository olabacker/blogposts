Stack vs heap allocations | [.net] [c#] [memory]

Whilst many developers know the difference of datatypes being stored on either the heap or stack depending on different factors there are some things which are not as obvious.

|Type        |Allocation    |
| -----------|--------------
| reference types | heap
| value type declared as variable in method | stack  |  
| value type declared as parameter in method | stack |
| value type declared as member of class | heap |
| value type declared as member of struct | where the parent is allocated|
| ref struct | stack |
