Extension for browsing the web with keyboard only ⌨️


While many software engineers are keen on using only their keyboards only during work browsing the web is usually more tedious when trying to tab through pages.

# Navigating

`Ctrl`+`L` goes to the address bar.

After entering a link the focus will shift to the page.

If you simply wanted to go to the address bar to copy the address or decide to stay on the page you need to press `F6` twice to get back to the content.

# Opening links

Without any extension this is super tedious since you need to tab all through pages to reach a certain link.

I recommend using [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) which adds many keyboard capabilites to the browser. Primarily for me it gives you the ability to press `Shift`+`F` which maps the entire views links with shortcut combinations allowing you to quickly navigate to them.


# Viewing pages

Simply using `PgUp` and `PgDn` is sufficient but vimium also provides smooth scrolling with `J` and `K`.
