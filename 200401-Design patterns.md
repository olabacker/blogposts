Design patterns | [cs]

## Singleton 

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is often used for logging, driver objects, or for managing a single connection to a shared resource.

## Observer

The Observer pattern allows objects to be notified when the state of another object changes. This pattern is often used in event-driven systems, such as user interfaces, to update multiple objects when a particular event occurs.

## Decorator

This pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is often used to add new functionality to an existing class without changing its source code.

## Factory
This pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It is often used to create objects that belong to a particular class hierarchy.

## Command

This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, which allows the request to be treated as a method call, with support for undo/redo, auditing, and deferred execution.

## Adapter

This pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an instance of one class with an adapter class that conforms to the interface of the other class.

Facade: This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system or library. It is often used to make a large, complex system more manageable by hiding its internal complexity behind a simple, easy-to-use interface.
