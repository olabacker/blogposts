Useful ⌨️ shortcuts in Rider after switching from visual studio  | [rider]


After using visual studio a couple of years I decided to try out Rider. My initial feeling is that it has a better flow to it and it is easier to work with the keyboard only.

## Master command to find available actions

Lists available commands and its associated keyboard shortcut
```sh
'Ctrl' + 'Shift' + 'A'
```
This is making it way easier to remember the shortcuts since you can search for the command and view the shortcut in the menu.


## Navigation


### Move to solution explorer

```sh
'Ctrl' + 'Alt' + 'L'
```

### Move to open file in solution explorer

```sh
'Shift' + 'Alt' + 'L'
```


## Debug

### Move up/down in error/warning list

```sh
'Ctrl' + 'Alt' + 'Up'/'Down'
```

## Run

### Run anything

```sh
'Ctrl' + 'Ctrl'
```
