Extension for browsing the web with keyboard only ⌨️


While many software engineers are keen on using only their keyboards only during work browsing the web is usually more tedious when trying to tab through pages.

# What is vimium?



# Shortcuts

`f` - Maps page with keyboard shortcuts to every link, pressing the corresponding keys presses the link.

`Shift`+ `f` - The same as above except the link is forced to open in new tab

`j` / `k`  - Smooth scroll down and up respectively

`h` / `l` - Scroll left and right respectively 




# Opening links

Without any extension this is super tedious since you need to tab all through pages to reach a certain link.


I recommend using [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) which adds many keyboard capabilites to the browser. Primarily for me it gives you the ability to press `Shift`+`F` which maps the entire views links with shortcut combinations allowing you to quickly navigate to them.


# Viewing pages

Simply using `PgUp` and `PgDn` is sufficient but vimium also provides smooth scrolling with `J` and `K`.
