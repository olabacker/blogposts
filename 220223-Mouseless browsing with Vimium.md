Extension for browsing the web with keyboard only ⌨️

While many software engineers are keen on using only their keyboards only during work browsing the web is usually more tedious when trying to tab through pages to reach a certain link.

# Vimium

[Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) is a browser extension for browsing the web without using keyboard giving a similar experience to using vim.

# Example shortcuts

![alt text](images/vimium-example.png "Logo Title Text 1")

`f` - Maps page with keyboard shortcuts to every link, pressing the corresponding keys presses the link.

`Shift`+ `f` - The same as above except the link is forced to open in new tab

`j` / `k`  - Smooth scroll down and up respectively

`h` / `l` - Scroll left and right respectively 

# Conclusion 

This extension really allowed me to actually put the mouse aside in the common workflows.
