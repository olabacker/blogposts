# Clean repo from files which are excluded by .gitignore

If you have commited files to a repo and added gitignore rules afterwards, this command will clean up files which should no longer be present.

```sh
git ls-files -i -c --exclude-from=.gitignore | %{git rm --cached $_}
```

# Submodules

clone a repo containing submodules

```sh
git clone --recursive [giturl]
```

initializes the submodules after cloning a repo, add recursive if nested submodules
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```


pull all changes in the repo including changes in the submodules
```sh
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

pull all changes for the submodules
```sh
git submodule update --remote
```

# Fetching someone else repo fork on github

 After forking a repo on GitHub and wanting to get the code from a branch on another user's fork. 

```sh
git remote add theirusername https://github.com/theirusername/reponame
git fetch theirusername
```

After fetching their remote the branches are available for checkout

```sh
git checkout -b mynamefortheirbranch theirusername/theirbranch
```


# View branches

View local branches with `branch`, add `-r` to get remote branches.

```sh
git branch -r
```


# Pretty log ✨

![alt text](images/gitlogs.png "Awesome log")

*Pretty looking log with very professional commit messages*

If you like a pretty log graph over your commit history, this command should do the trick.

```sh
git log --pretty=oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

I suggest aliasing it asap!

# Initalizing a git repository in an existing folder using github cli

My projects usually start out before being in source control, thi


Initialize the repo

git init -b main --private

Create the repository on github

git add . 
git commit -m "initial commit" 
git push

Set the origin upstream and push the initial commit

# Gitignore

If you want to ignore all files in a folder, you can use the following syntax

```sh
folder/*
```
