# Clean repo from files which are excluded by .gitignore

If you have commited files to a repo and added gitignore rules afterwards, this command will clean up files which should no longer be present.

```powershell
git ls-files -i -c --exclude-from=.gitignore | %{git rm --cached $_}
```

# Submodules

clone a repo containing submodules

```powershell
git clone --recursive [giturl]
```

initializes the submodules after cloning a repo, add recursive if nested submodules
```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```


pull all changes in the repo including changes in the submodules
```powershell
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

pull all changes for the submodules
```powershell
git submodule update --remote
```

# Fetching someone else repo fork on github

 After forking a repo on GitHub and wanting to get the code from a branch on another user's fork. 

```powershell
git remote add theirusername https://github.com/theirusername/reponame
git fetch theirusername
```

After fetching their remote the branches are available for checkout

```powershell
git checkout -b mynamefortheirbranch theirusername/theirbranch
```


# View branches

View local branches with `branch`, add `-r` to get remote branches.

```powershell
git branch -r
```


# Pretty log ✨

*Pretty looking log with very professional commit messages*

If you like a pretty log graph over your commit history, this command should do the trick.

```powershell
git log --pretty=oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

I suggest aliasing it asap!
